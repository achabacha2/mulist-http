## Manual Install : Clone, Config, Deploy

1) Clone or download this repo

2) Edit config.js :

`port (80 | 443 | ...)` is required and must be an integer. In development you can define it directly with the command `PORT=8080 npm start`.

`host` is optionnal but for some web hosting / PaaS an IP is required like Openshift Online (`process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP`). You can provide an empty host or simply comment it.

`https (false | true)` is optionnal. `false` or simply not defined is usually the best choice because most of web hosting / PaaS already provide https. If `true`, the app will automatically generate certificates with `openssl` and handle https. Note that openssl must be installed with this option.

`key` is optionnal and should be used only for development purpose. It disables the crypto auto-generation access key.

3) Deploy all files on OpenShift Online, Heroku, AWS.. or your own server
